# Windows + OneDrive Notes

- Building/starting Next.js within a OneDrive-synced folder may fail with EPERM on files like `.next/trace` or `dist/trace`, or missing `routes-manifest.json` at runtime.
- Preferred: move the project out of OneDrive (e.g., `C:\Projects\setup-tutorial`).
- Alternative: pause OneDrive sync while building/starting the app.
- Do not rely on `distDir` changes to fix OneDrive lockâ€”locks also affect the new folder.
