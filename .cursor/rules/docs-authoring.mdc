# Docs Authoring Rules

- Tool docs live in [content/each-tool-explained/](mdc:content/each-tool-explained). Filename must equal the route slug with `.md` extension.
- Use simple GitHub-flavored Markdown. Avoid heavy client-side markdown libraries in routes; render server-side when possible.
- Structure per doc:
  - Title: `# <Tool Name>`
  - What it does, required inputs, typical outputs
  - Examples (code fences), gotchas, limits/timeouts
  - Cross-links to related tools and setup steps
- Keep headings concise to enable a generated table of contents later.
- For new tools added in AFBT, create a matching markdown file here and validate `/tools/<slug>` renders properly.
